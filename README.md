# Sermon Analyzer

## MVP TODO:
* add a way to see who is signed in & option to delete account
* test on mobile
* set up pwa
* setup oauth login for google/apple etc...
* find mail provider (Brevo / Mailersend)
* test emails
* create docker env
* squash migrations
* set "APP_ENV" env variable to configure stuff like auto-migrate
* deploy to fly.io

## Nice to haves
* allow admins to re-run sermon analysis (will need job types)

## 1.0
* Astro with site homepage
* figure out user "groupings"
