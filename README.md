## MVP TODO:
* Allow admins to delete sermons
* add search functionality to find sermons
* add a way to see who is signed in & option to delete account
* test on mobile
* setup oauth login for google/apple etc...
* set up pwa
* find mail provider (Brevo / Mailersend)
* create docker env
* deploy to fly.io

## Nice to haves
